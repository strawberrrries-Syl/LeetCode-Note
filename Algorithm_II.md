## About max:
```java
max({int1, in2, in3});  //get max value from a set of number.
```
## Thinking
1. ALWAYS remember to sort a vector first. This can help you to prevent a lot of work when you try to keep no duplication.
2. Hashmap is faster than lots of method. Try to use this no matter what you are doing.
3. Remember to `clear` containers
4. Calm down.
